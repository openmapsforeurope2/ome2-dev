# au_matching â€“ Technical Documentation

## Overview

**au_matching** is a C++ application, part of the Open Maps For Europe 2 (OME2) project, dedicated to the automated matching and reconciliation of administrative unit boundaries across European countries. It implements spatial algorithms for cross-border feature matching, geometry refinement, and robust data integration, and is intended for use in large-scale (1:10,000) pan-European mapping workflows.

---

## Architecture & Build

### Build System

- Uses **CMake** for cross-platform build configuration.
- Depends on several spatial and database libraries:  
  - Boost, GEOS, CGAL, GMP, MPFR, Shapelib, PostgreSQL (libpq), SQLite, and several OME2/IGN libraries (e.g., Socle, LibEPG).
- The project is built as a single executable.

**Example build (Unix):**
```sh
./build-unix-release.sh
```
Or using Docker:
```sh
docker build --build-arg GIT_BRANCH=main --build-arg NB_PROC=4 -t au_matching .
```

### Docker Support

A `Dockerfile` is provided for reproducible builds and deployment. The Docker image is built on top of `libepg` and compiles the project using the provided CMake configuration.

## Main Components

### Core Matching Logic

- **src/app/calcul/AuMatchingOp.cpp/.h**  
  Implements the main matching operator, with logic for boundary alignment, angle computation, and matching operations.
  - Key methods:
    - `Compute(std::string countryCode, bool verbose)`
    - Internal steps: initialization, matching computation, geometry feature extraction.

- **src/app/calcul/InitLandmaskCoastOp.cpp**  
  Specialized operator for initializing landmask and coastal boundary features as part of the matching process.

- **src/app/detail/refining.cpp**, **extractNotTouchingParts.cpp**, etc.  
  Helper modules for geometry refinement, extracting non-touching parts, and other spatial processing routines.

- **src/main.cpp**  
  Application entry point. Handles parsing of configuration/parameter files, logging setup, and orchestrates the matching steps through a suite of "steps" (processing stages).

### External Dependencies

- **OME2/IGN Libraries**: Provides foundational geometry, database, and utility classes.
- **Boost**: Progress reporting and other utilities.
- **GEOS/CGAL**: Geometry processing and computational geometry.
- **PostgreSQL/SQLite**: Database access for feature storage and queries.

---

## Build & Install

- **CMakeLists.txt**:  
  Handles include/library paths, links against dependencies, and configures the build.  
  Output executable is placed in `bin/Release` or `bin/Debug` depending on build type.

- **build-unix-release.sh** and **build-unix-package.sh**:  
  Shell scripts to automate build and (optionally) packaging via CPack.

## Usage

### Command-line

The application is typically run with configuration files specifying:
- EPG parameters (`--c`)
- Theme parameters (`--t`)
- Step codes, country codes, and other options

**Example:**
```sh
./au_matching --c path/to/epg_parameters.ini --t path/to/theme_parameters.ini --stepcode STEP_X --cc DE
```
For detailed options, run with `--help`.

### Input/Output

- Reads/writes features to/from spatial databases (PostgreSQL/PostGIS, SQLite).
- Operates on shapefiles as needed for testing or debugging.
